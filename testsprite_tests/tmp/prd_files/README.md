# Anoma Intent Demo - Flagship Application

A flagship demo application showcasing the power of intent-centric applications built on Anoma's distributed operating system.

## 🚀 Overview

This demo application demonstrates how Anoma's intent-centric approach revolutionizes blockchain application development. Instead of dealing with complex smart contracts, cross-chain bridges, and gas fees, users simply declare their intentions and let Anoma handle the rest.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intent-Centric Interface**: Declare what you want to achieve in natural language
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Seamlessly work across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more
- **Real-time Intent Processing**: Watch as your intents are processed and executed
- **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Interactive Demo**: Hands-on experience with intent creation and management

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

The application showcases four main intent types:

1. **Cross-Chain Swap**: Swap tokens across different blockchains seamlessly
2. **Bridge Assets**: Bridge assets between different blockchain networks
3. **Stake & Earn**: Stake tokens and earn rewards across multiple chains
4. **Yield Farming**: Automatically find and deploy to the best yield opportunities

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

## 🎭 Intent-Centric Architecture

This demo showcases the core principles of intent-centric applications:

1. **Declarative Programming**: Users express what they want, not how to achieve it
2. **Cross-Chain Abstraction**: Seamless interaction across multiple blockchains
3. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on outcomes rather than technical implementation
4. **Automatic Orchestration**: Complex operations handled automatically by the intent machine

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration with real Anoma testnet
- Wallet connectivity
- Real-time blockchain data
- Advanced intent composition
- Multi-language support
- Mobile app version
